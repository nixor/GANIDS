Take an elite individual as input
Identify any genetic locus containing a wildcard value of that elite
Randomly select a locus from the identified ones
Generate a type double random value between 0.00 to 1.00, store it as Rand
IF (Rand < The probability of mutation)
	Replace that locus genetic value with a random value from the locus' allele
Add the mutated individual into the offspring population
